Role & Description

IBM WatsonX.ai

The core platform for building, training, and managing the AI models that power the agent's conversational abilities.

IBM Cloud

Provides the robust, scalable cloud infrastructure for hosting and deploying the application, ensuring high availability.

Node.js / Python

The backend runtime environment used to integrate the WatsonX services and manage the application logic. (Select the one you used)

<hr>

workflow Architecture
This AI Travel Agent operates through a seamless cloud-based architecture:

User Input: The user interacts with the agent through a chat interface.

WatsonX NLU: The user's query is sent to IBM WatsonX, which uses its Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities to identify intents (e.g., plan_trip) and entities (e.g., destination:Paris, duration:7-days).

Backend Logic (IBM Cloud): The application logic, running on IBM Cloud, receives the structured data from WatsonX. It then processes the request, which may involve calling external APIs for flight/hotel data or using its internal knowledge base.

Response Generation: The backend formulates a helpful response. For complex queries like itinerary planning, it generates a detailed, structured answer.

User Interface: The final response is sent back and displayed to the user in the chat interface.

üöÄ Future Scope
Multi-Language Support: Train the agent to understand and respond in multiple languages.

Direct Booking Integration: Connect with third-party APIs (like Amadeus or Skyscanner) to allow users to book flights and hotels directly through the chat interface.

Voice Interaction: Enable voice input and output for a hands-free planning experience.

Proactive Alerts: Implement a feature to send users real-time alerts about flight price drops or travel advisories for their planned trips.
